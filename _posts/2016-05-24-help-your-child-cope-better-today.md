## Help Your Child Cope Better - Today!

Has your child been diagnosed with [ADHD/ADD][0]? 

What does that mean for your child, you, and your family? 

Have you always received a lot of different reactions to your child's behaviour from others? Are you sick and tired of hearing or seeing people talking about you behind your back saying you are not a fit parent and your child needs discipline? Still having those embarrassing shopping trips & outings? Still have to plan everything to the last detail?

As parents of 3 ADHD children - now grown ups - we understand what you are going through and how you feel! Been there and done that!

You are NOT alone, you are not failures as parents and now you can help your child live a more fulfilled & comfortable life - you will see a difference within a short few weeks sometimes even within a few days!

After more than 20 years of searching for a solution we finally found a clinically tested program used extensively in Sweden since the 80's. It is simple, effective and only takes 10-15 minutes per day at home.

Rhythmic Movement Training (BRMT) is successfully reducing sensory, behavioural, social, emotional and learning issues associated with ADHD/ADD. As fully qualified and experienced BRMT & Brainbuzzz practitioners we are passionate about helping your child become the best they can be.

Private screening and treatment is done at your home to reduce stress levels, get in touch today to learn more!

Warm regards

Vips & Simon Kirrage
